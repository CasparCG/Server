COMMON SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR WINDOWS AND LINUX
------------------------------------------------

- Intel processor capable of using SSSE3 instructions.
  Please refer to
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSSE3 for a complete list.
  While AMD processors might work, CasparCG Server has only been tested on Intel
  processors.

- A graphics card (GPU) capable of OpenGL 3.0 is required.
  We strongly recommend that you use a separate graphics card, and avoid
  using the built-in GPU that exists in many CPUs. Your playback performance
  might suffer if using a built-in GPU.
